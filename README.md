This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works
With some predefined action sequences, it finds the sequence of actions that yields the best quality gain under given constraints (CP, durability, manipulation).
This is, however, limited to the condition that you are at 11 Inner Quiet stack and is 1 action (Basic Synthesis or Careful Synthesis) away from finishing the craft.
